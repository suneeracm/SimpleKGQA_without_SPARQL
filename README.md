# SimpleKGQA_without_SPARQL
This is is the source code of our paper entitled "Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs using BERT based Relation mapping". 
'My_model' is an LSTM model trained on trec dataset for question classification. 
The function find_ans_n(q) in SimpleQA_hybrid_.ipynb retreives the answer from DBpedia for natural language question, q.
Also provided the test sets we used in our paper with results. We done the implementation in google colab, so the notebook is of the same.
